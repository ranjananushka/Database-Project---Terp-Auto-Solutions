The main objectives of the project are as follows:

Service Management:
Implement a service module to maintain a list of services provided to cars at the dealership based on customer requests.

Car Information Management:
Develop a robust database structure to store and manage complete information about cars being sold, including make, model, year, VIN, mileage, and other relevant details.

Client Management:
Establish a client management system to keep track of all clients who visit the dealership to purchase or service their cars. This includes storing client details such as name, contact information, and transaction history.

Mechanic Information Management:
Create a database module to maintain complete information about mechanics working at the dealership, including their names, expertise, certifications, and other relevant details.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to streamline the operations of Terp Motor Dealer, providing efficient management of car services, maintaining accurate car and client information, and ensuring effective tracking of mechanics involved in the servicing process.
